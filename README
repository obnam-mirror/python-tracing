README for python-tracing
=========================

This package provides the Python library 'tracing' to help with logging 
debug messages.

This package provides 'tracing' module, with a couple of functions for 
logging debug messages. It is sometimes practical to add a lot of 
debugging log messages to a program, but having them enabled all the 
time results in very large log files. Also, logging that much takes 
quite a bit of time.

This module provides a way to turn such debugging or tracing messages
on and off, based on the filename they occur in.
